export const Section11 = `(1) Save as provided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, because of—
${indent1}(a) its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services covered by the trade mark; or
${indent1}(b) its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,
there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.
${newLine}(2) A trade mark which—
${indent1}(a) is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and
${indent1}(b) is to be registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered in the name of a different proprietor,
shall not be registered if or to the extent the earlier trade mark is a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark.
${newLine}(3) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in India is liable to be prevented—
${indent1}(a) by virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off protecting an unregistered trade mark used in the course of trade; or
${indent1}(b) by virtue of law of copyright.
${newLine}(4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a trade mark where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right consents to the registration, and in such case the Registrar may register the mark under special circumstances under section 12.
${newLine}Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, earlier trade mark means—
${indent1}1[(a) a registered trade mark or an application under section 18 bearing an earlier date of filing or an international registration referred to in section 36E or convention application referred to in section 154 which has a date of application earlier than that of the trade mark in question, taking account, where appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of the trade marks;]
${indent1}(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the application for registration of the trade mark in question, or where appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application, was entitled to protection as a well-known trade mark.
${newLine}(5) A trade mark shall not be refused registration on the grounds specified in sub-sections (2) and (3), unless objection on any one or more of those grounds is raised in opposition proceedings by the proprietor of the earlier trade mark.
${newLine}(6) The Registrar shall, while determining whether a trade mark is a well-known trade mark, take into account any fact which he considers relevant for determining a trade mark as a well-known trade mark including—
${indent1}(i) the knowledge or recognition of that trade mark in the relevant section of the public including knowledge in India obtained as a result of promotion of the trade mark;
${indent1}(ii) the duration, extent and geographical area of any use of that trade mark;
${indent1}(iii) the duration, extent and geographical area of any promotion of the trade mark, including advertising or publicity and presentation, at fairs or exhibition of the goods or services to which the trade mark applies;
${indent1}(iv) the duration and geographical area of any registration of or any application for registration of that trade mark under this Act to the extent that they reflect the use or recognition of the trade mark;
${indent1}(v) the record of successful enforcement of the rights in that trade mark, in particular the extent to which the trade mark has been recognised as a well-known trade mark by any court or Registrar under that record.
${newLine}(7) The Registrar shall, while determining as to whether a trade mark is known or recognised in a relevant section of the public for the purposes of sub-section (6), take into account—
${indent1}(i) the number of actual or potential consumers of the goods or services;
${indent1}(ii) the number of persons involved in the channels of distribution of the goods or services;
${indent1}(iii) the business circles dealing with the goods or services, to which that trade mark applies.
${newLine}(8) Where a trade mark has been determined to be well known in at least one relevant section of the public in India by any court or Registrar, the Registrar shall consider that trade mark as a well-known trade mark for registration under this Act.
${newLine}(9) The Registrar shall not require as a condition, for determining whether a trade mark is a well-known trade mark, any of the following, namely:—
${indent1}(i) that the trade mark has been used in India;
${indent1}(ii) that the trade mark has been registered;
${indent1}(iii) that the application for registration of the trade mark has been filed in India;
${indent1}(iv) that the trade mark—
${indent2}(a) is well-known in; or
${indent2}(b) has been registered in; or
${indent2}(c) in respect of which an application for registration has been filed in, any jurisdiction other than India; or
${indent1}(v) that the trade mark is well-known to the public at large in India.
${newLine}(10) While considering an application for registration of a trade mark and opposition filed in respect thereof, the Registrar shall—
${indent2}(i) protect a well-known trade mark against the identical or similar trade marks;
${indent2}(ii) take into consideration the bad faith involved either of the applicant or the opponent affecting the right relating to the trade mark.
${newLine}(11) Where a trade mark has been registered in good faith disclosing the material informations to the Registrar or where right to a trade mark has been acquired through use in good faith before the commencement of this Act, then, nothing in this Act shall prejudice the validity of the registration of that trade mark or right to use that trade mark on the ground that such trade mark is identical with or similar to a well-known trade mark.`;
